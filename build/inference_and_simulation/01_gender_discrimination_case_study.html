# Study description and data

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 7%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

.footnote[B.Rosen and T. Jerdee (1974), "Influence of sex role stereotypes on personnel decisions", J.Applied Psychology, 59:9-14.]

*   In 1972, as a part of a study on gender discrimination, 48 male bank supervisors were each given the same personnel file and asked to judge whether the person should be promoted to a branch manager job that was described as "routine". 

*   The files were identical except that half of the supervisors had files showing the person was male while the other half had files showing the person was female.

*   It was randomly determined which supervisors got "male" applications and which got "female" applications.  

*   Of the 48 files reviewed, 35 were promoted. 

*   The study is testing whether females are unfairly discriminated against.

# Data

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 7%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

.qa[
At a first glance, does there appear to be a relatonship between promotion and gender?
]

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 7%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

|        | Promoted | Not Promoted | Total |
| ---    | ---      | ---          | ---   |
| Male   | 21       | 3            | 24    |
| Female | 14       | 10           | 24    |
| Total  | 35       | 13           | 48    |

--

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 7%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

**% of males promoted:** 21 / 24 = 0.875

**% of females promoted:** 14 / 24 = 0.583

# Practice

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 7%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

.qa[
We saw a difference of almost 30% (29.2% to be exact) between the proportion of male and female files that are promoted.
Based on this information, which of the below is true?
]

1.  If we were to repeat the experiment we will definitely see that more female files get promoted. This was a fluke.

2.  Promotion is dependent on gender, males are more likely to be promoted, and hence there is gender discrimination against women in promotion decisions. &lt;span style="opacity: 0;"&gt;Maybe&lt;/span&gt;

3.  The difference in the proportions of promoted male and female files is due to chance, this is not evidence of gender discrimination against women in promotion decisions. &lt;span style="opacity: 0;"&gt;Maybe&lt;/span&gt;

4.  Women are less qualified than men, and this is why fewer females get promoted.

# One-sided tests

The p-value is *the probability of a getting a value at least as extreme as the observed statistic from the null distribution*.

What do we mean by extreme?

--

In a one-sided hypothesis test, we care about extreme values on one side of the distribution:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simulation_results %>%
  visualize(bins = 9) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = experiment_result, direction = "right") +
  labs(
    title = "Gender discrimination null distribution",
    x = "difference in fraction of male and female promotions"
  ) +
  xlim(-0.8, 0.6) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The\nobserved\nstatistic",
    x = 0.45,
    y = 4000
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 3250,
    xend = 0.29,
    yend = 2500,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The differences\nin proportions of promotions\nfrom 10,000 random permutations\nof the original data",
    x = -0.44,
    y = 3000,
    size = 3.5
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = -0.14,
    y = 2500,
    xend = -0.07,
    yend = 1700,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "More\nextreme",
    x = 0.45,
    y = 1400
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 900,
    xend = 0.35,
    yend = 250,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  )
```

# Side matters for one-sided tests

Our test statistic is $\frac{promoted\_men}{all\_men} - \frac{promoted\_women}{all\_women}$.

Because we care about whether more men are promoted than women, extreme values will be on the right.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simulation_results %>%
  visualize(bins = 9) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = experiment_result, direction = "right") +
  labs(
    title = "Gender discrimination null distribution",
    x = "difference in fraction of male and female promotions"
  ) +
  xlim(-0.8, 0.6) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The\nobserved\nstatistic",
    x = 0.45,
    y = 4000
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 3250,
    xend = 0.29,
    yend = 2500,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The differences\nin proportions of promotions\nfrom 10,000 random permutations\nof the original data",
    x = -0.44,
    y = 3000,
    size = 3.5
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = -0.14,
    y = 2500,
    xend = -0.07,
    yend = 1700,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "More\nextreme",
    x = 0.45,
    y = 1400
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 900,
    xend = 0.35,
    yend = 250,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  )
```

# Side matters for one-sided tests

Our test statistic is $\frac{promoted\_men}{all\_men} - \frac{promoted\_women}{all\_women}$.

If we accidentally try to calculate the fraction of values on the left, we will get an erroneously high fraction (p-value).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simulation_results %>%
  visualize(bins = 9) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = experiment_result, direction = "left") +
  labs(
    title = "Gender discrimination null distribution",
    x = "difference in fraction of male and female promotions"
  ) +
  xlim(-0.8, 0.6) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The\nobserved\nstatistic",
    x = 0.45,
    y = 4000
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 3250,
    xend = 0.29,
    yend = 2500,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "Not the \"extreme values\"\nyou are looking for",
    x = -0.4,
    y = 3000
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = -0.14,
    y = 2500,
    xend = -0.06,
    yend = 1700,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  )
```

# Side matters for one-sided tests

But if the test statistic was reversed: $\frac{promoted\_women}{all\_women} - \frac{promoted\_men}{all\_men}$

--

...now "extreme" values of the test statistic will be negative (if more men are promoted than women), so we need to look on the left:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simulation_results %>%
  visualize(bins = 9) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = -experiment_result, direction = "left") +
  labs(
    title = "Gender discrimination null distribution",
    x = "difference between fraction of female and male promotions"
  ) +
  xlim(-0.8, 0.6) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The\nobserved\nstatistic",
    x = -0.45,
    y = 4000
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = -0.4,
    y = 3250,
    xend = -0.29,
    yend = 2500,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "More\nextreme",
    x = -0.6,
    y = 1000
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = -0.6,
    y = 500,
    xend = -0.4,
    yend = 200,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  )
```

# Two-sided tests

But in a two-sided test, we care about extreme value on both side of the distribution:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simulation_results %>%
  visualize(bins = 9) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = experiment_result, direction = "both") +
  labs(
    title = "Gender discrimination null distribution",
    x = "difference in fraction of male and female promotions"
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The observed\nstatistic",
    x = 0.44,
    y = 4000
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 3500,
    xend = 0.3,
    yend = 3000,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "More\nextreme",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 1400
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 900,
    xend = 0.35,
    yend = 250,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "Also more\nextreme",
    x = -0.4,
    y = 1400
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = -0.4,
    y = 900,
    xend = -0.35,
    yend = 250,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  )
```

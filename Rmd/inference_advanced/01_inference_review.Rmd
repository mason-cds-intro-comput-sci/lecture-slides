# What is inference?

**Statistical inference:** How do we tell if a difference in some data is meaningful, or occurred due to chance variation?

--

E.g. 48 bank supervisors were given the same resume and asked if they would promote the person to branch manager... 24 got the resume with a male name, the other half got it with a female name.

* 21 of the 24 male-resume reviewers said yes.

* 14 of the 24 female-resume reviewers said yes.

That's a difference of $21/24 - 14/24 = 0.3$

Is this difference significant? I.e. how likely are we to get such a result at random?

---

# Hypotheses

As scientists we first come up with testable hypotheses:

The **null hypothesis** always states that there is no difference in the test statistic.

* *There is no difference in the proportion of male and female candidates promoted.*

The **alternative hypothesis** is the alternative, i.e. that there is a difference in the test statistic.

* *Men are significantly more like to be promoted than women.*

---

# The null distribution

Why does the null hypothesis always state that there is no difference?

--

Because we can generate a distribution of the random variation that we would expect to see in the **observed statistic** *if the null hypothesis is true*:

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
applicants_data <- read_rds("../../data/gender_discrimination.rds")
experiment_result <- (21/24) - (14/24)

simulation_results <- applicants_data %>%
  specify(outcome ~ sex, success = "Promoted") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = combine("Male", "Female"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simulation_results %>%
  visualize(bins = 9) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = experiment_result, direction = "right") +
  labs(
    title = "Gender discrimination null distribution",
    x = "Difference in fraction of male and female promotions"
  ) +
  xlim(-0.8, 0.6) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The\nobserved\nstatistic",
    x = 0.45,
    y = 4000
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 3250,
    xend = 0.29,
    yend = 2500,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The differences\nin proportions of promotions\nfrom 10,000 random permutations\nof the original data",
    x = -0.44,
    y = 3000,
    size = 3.5
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = -0.14,
    y = 2500,
    xend = -0.07,
    yend = 1700,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  )
```

# The p-value

The p-value is the probability of observing a value from the null distribution as or more extreme as the observed statistic.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
simulation_results %>%
  visualize(bins = 9) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = experiment_result, direction = "right") +
  labs(
    title = "Gender discrimination null distribution",
    x = "difference in fraction of male and female promotions"
  ) +
  xlim(-0.8, 0.6) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The\nobserved\nstatistic",
    x = 0.45,
    y = 4000
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 3250,
    xend = 0.29,
    yend = 2500,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "The differences\nin proportions of promotions\nfrom 10,000 random permutations\nof the original data",
    x = -0.44,
    y = 3000,
    size = 3.5
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = -0.14,
    y = 2500,
    xend = -0.07,
    yend = 1700,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    label = "More\nextreme",
    x = 0.45,
    y = 1400
  ) +
  annotate(
    "segment",
    x = 0.4,
    y = 900,
    xend = 0.35,
    yend = 250,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type="closed")
  )
```

# Interpretation

The p-value is the probability of observing a value from the null distribution as or more extreme as the observed statistic.

Compare p-value to a significance threshold, $\alpha$, of 0.05.

If $p < 0.05$ then we reject the null hypothesis (alternatively, we can say that we accept the alternative hypothesis).

* *Why? Because we are saying there is a less than 5% chance that a difference as extreme as we observed would have come from the null distribution.*

Otherwise ( $p > 0.05$ ), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

* *We are saying there is a strong chance that the data could have arisen randomly.*

???

Note we never prove/disprove a hypothesis.

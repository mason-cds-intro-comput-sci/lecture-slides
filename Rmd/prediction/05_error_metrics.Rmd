# Two reasons to model

.pull-left[
## Understanding

* Aims to explain how explanatory variables cause a change in the response variable.

* We want a model that fits the data well, explaining as much of the varibility in the response variable as possible.

* We want to know how important different explanatory variables are, so we prefer simple models that are easy to interpret.

* We assess the model using inference, such as $R^2$, confidence intervals, and *p*-values.

.pull-right[
## Prediction

* Aim is to make accurate predictions about future data.

* Want the most accurate model possible (often more complex), but care less about the relative importance of each explanatory variable.

* Model is assessed in terms of how accurately it predicts "unseen" data that was not used to create the model.

Understanding. Purpose is to give insights, rather than make accurate predictions about unseen data

# Models for prediction

There are many different *algorithms* we can use to create models (an algorithm is a computer program that produces a model):

* Linear regression

--

* Generalized linear regression (GLM)

* k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

* Random Forests

* ...and many more

--

They can broadly be classified into *regression* models (when we are trying to predict a continous value) and *classification* models (for categorical predictions).

# Machine learning

The discipline of creating predictive models is called **machine learning**.

Because machine learning grew out of computer science rather than statistics, they came up with different names for many existing statistical concepts:

* explanatory variables are called *predictor variables* or *features*.

* the response variable (i.e. the thing we are trying to predict) is called the *target variable* (or sometimes the *labels* if we are predicting categorical values).

* the process of creating a model is referred to as *"learning"* from the data, or *"fitting"* a model.

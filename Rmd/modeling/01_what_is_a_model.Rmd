# What do we mean by "modeling"?

.answer.center[A model is a simplified representation of reality.]

# Why do we need mathematical models?

* Models allow us to simplify observed data about the world into just a few parameters.

* For example, we might fit a straight line through some points:

<!-- Although this doesn't represent all the variation in the data, it simplifies a large dataset down to just two numbers: the slope of the line and the intercept. -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(sim1, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```

* Models can be used to measure the relationship between variables, or to make predictions.

# The limitations of models

.qa[*All models are wrong but some are useful.* - George Box]

* Poorly constructed models can misrepresent real relationships.

* Correlation does not imply causation.

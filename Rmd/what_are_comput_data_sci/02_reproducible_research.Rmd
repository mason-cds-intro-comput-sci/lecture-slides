**Key point:** create a hypothesis and collect evidence to test it out

* Empirical observations constitute evidence.

* A hypothesis is compared with the outcomes of the natural world ("Nature"), not voted on by an individual or a committee

* A hypothesis should be testable by anyone, regardless of time, place, culture, etc. Anyone can double check an experiment!

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 12%">Reproducibility in practice</h1>

The scientific ideal of reproducibility is sometimes easier said than done, and there many reasons why this is the case:

--

* Lack of funding sources

--

* Lack of data sharing

--

* Lack of interest

--

* "Top-tier" journals won't publish

--

* Vague methods

--

* And more...

# Why is reproducibility hard?

A few reasons:

* Lack of funding sources
* Lack of data sharing
* Lack of interest
* "Top-tier" journals won't publish
* Vague methods

> Brian Nosek of University of Virginia and colleagues sought out to replicate 100 different studies that all were published in 2008. The project pulled these studies from three different [psychology] journals... to see if they could get the same results as the initial findings. [...] Only 36.1% of the studies [were] replicated.

* C. Reinhart and K. Rogoff, "Growth in a Time of Debt", Amer. Econ. Rev. **100**, 573-578 (2010)

* Influential economics paper that found that when a country's GDP to debt ratio reaches 90%, GDP growth is cut almost in half.

* Cited as evidence for implementing austerity measures post-2008 financial crisis

* Dataset and analysis were not made public at time of publication

<div style="margin-top: 8%;"></div>

A graduate student at U. Mass. Amherst, Thomas Herndon, tried to replicate the study's results using publicly available country spreadsheet data as homework for one of his classes...
--
...and could not.

--

In 2013, Herndon wrote to Reinhart and Rogoff asking for their dataset, and they obliged.

--

After receiving the data and analysis, Herndon, working with two of his professors, published a critique based on the following:

--

1. The accidental exclusion of available data and data gaps

2. A spreadsheet coding error

3. Unconventional weighting of summary statistics

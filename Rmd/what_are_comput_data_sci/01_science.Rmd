# What is science?

<h2 style="margin-top:12%;">A set of facts</h2>

```{r pile-of-documents, echo = FALSE, out.width="20%", out.extra='style="display:float;position:fixed;top:15%;right:5%"'}
```

--

* We are constantly making new discoveries and collecting new data

--

* Technology and experiments are changing

--

* Old Theories are replaced by new Theories

--

* Scientific "Facts"

---

# What is science?

<h2 style="margin-top:12%;font-size:32px;">Something that professional scientists do</h2>

```{r scientist-icon, echo = FALSE, out.width="15%", out.extra='style="display:float;position:fixed;top:15%;right:5%"'}
```

--

* What is a scientist?

--

* Do you need a PhD?

--

* There are countless examples of amateur scientists playing a role in discovery

--

* Being scientific **does not** require becoming a member of a professional society

* Science is a process, not dogma

--

* Science experiments are able to falsify hypotheses, but they cannot prove that a claim is the *Truth*

--

* The predictive tools of science, models and simulations, are used to *represent* the world to the best of our current knowledge

---

<h1 style="margin-bottom:15%;">What is science?</h1>

--

* **Science**

  a study that uses the scientific method

--

* **Natural science**
  
  .quote-container[
  > The branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

<h1 style="margin-bottom:1.125em;">The scientific method</h1>

--

1. Review evidence

--

2. Hypothesis

--

3. Formulate predictive test

--

4. Design/run experiment

--

5. Validate or revise hypothesis

In practice, research programs don't strictly adhere to this step order. It's a list of principles, not a recipe.

.answer.center[**Key point:** create a hypothesis and collect evidence to test it out]

--

* Empirical observations constitute evidence.

--

* A hypothesis is compared with the outcomes of the natural world ("Nature"), not voted on by an individual or a committee

--

* A hypothesis should be testable by anyone, regardless of time, place, culture, etc. Anyone can double check an experiment!

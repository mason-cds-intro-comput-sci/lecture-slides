You can follow along by downloading and loading the dataset by placing the following *setup* code block at the top of a R Markdown file.

<div style="margin-bottom: -3%"></div>

# Simulations recap

<div style="margin-bottom: 7%"></div>

In the previous lecture, we ran the following simulations:

```r
# College applications null distribution
college_apps_null <- college_apps %>%
  specify(formula = number_colleges ~ NULL) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 8) %>%
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")

# Gender discrimation null distribution
simulation_results <- applicants_data %>%
  specify(outcome ~ sex, success = "Promoted") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = combine("Male", "Female"))
```

# .font80[Two-sided hypothesis testing with p-values]

.font90[
If the research question was "Do the data provide convincing evidence that the average amount of schools that GMU students apply to is **different** than the national average?", the alternative hypothesis would be different.

  .center[*H<sub>0</sub>* : *μ* = 8]
  .center[*H<sub>A</sub>* : *μ* ≠ 8]

The above is an example of a two-sided hypothesis test. In principle, the *p*-value of a two-sided test can be different from a one-sided test.

Computing the *p*-value of a two-sided hypothesis test is simple to do with .mono[infer], just change the .mono[direction] keyword in .mono[get_p_value()] from .mono["right"] to .mono["both"].

We can use the same null distribution that we generated earlier to compute the two-sided *p*-value for the gender discrimination experiment.

Conducting a two-sided hypothesis test means we are counting when the difference in the men and women hiring fractions is **larger** than `r experiment_result_round` and also when it is in the opposite extreme, which would be when the bias is towards hiring more women than men.

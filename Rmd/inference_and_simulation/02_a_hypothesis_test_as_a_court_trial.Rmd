# Two competing claims

<div style="margin-bottom: 20%;"></div>

1.  "There is nothing going on."

    Promotion and gender are **independent**, no gender discrimination, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. → **Null hypothesis**

2.  "There is something going on."

    Promotion and gender are **dependent**, there is gender discrimination, observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. → **Alternative hypothesis**

* As a process, hypothesis testing is analogous to a court trial

* *H<sub>0</sub>*: Defendant is innocent

  *H<sub>A</sub>*: Defendant is guilty

* We then present the evidence – collect data.

* Then we judge the evidence – "Could these data plausibly have happened by chance if the null hypothesis were true?"

* If they were very unlikely to have occurred, then the evidence raises more than a reasonable doubt in our minds about the null hypothesis

* Ultimately we must make a decision. How unlikely is unlikely?

# A trial as a hypothesis test

* If the evidence is not strong enough to reject the assumption of innocence, the jury returns with a verdict of "not guilty"

* The jury does not say that the defendant is innocent, just that there is not enough evidence to convict

* The defendant may, in fact, be innocent, but the jury has no way of being sure

* Said statistically, we fail to reject the null hypothesis

* We never declare the null hypothesis to be true, because we simply do not know whether it's true or not, therefore we never "accept the null hypothesis"

* In a trial, the burden of proof is on the prosecution.

* In a hypothesis test, the burden of proof is on the unusual claim.

* The null hypothesis is the ordinary state of affairs, so it's the alternative hypothesis that we consider unusual and for which we must gather evidence.

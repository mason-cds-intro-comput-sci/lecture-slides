# Number of college applications

.qa[
A survey asked how many colleges students applied to, and 206 students responded to this question.
This sample yielded an average of 9.7 college applications with a standard deviation of 7.
College Board website states that counselors recommend students apply to roughly 8 colleges.
Do these data provide convincing evidence that the average number of colleges all GMU students apply to is *higher* than recommended?

# Setting the hypotheses

* The **parameter of interest** is the average number of schools applied to by *all* GMU students.

* There may be two explanations why our sample mean is higher than the recommended 8 schools.

  * The true population mean is different
  * The true population mean is 8, and the difference between the true population mean and the sample mean is simply due to natural sampling variability

* We start with the assumption the average number of colleges GMU students apply to is 8 (as recommended)

  .center[*H<sub>0</sub>* : *μ* = 8]

* We test the claim that the average number of colleges GMU students apply to is greater than 8

  .center[*H<sub>A</sub>* : *μ* > 8]

---

# Statistical significance

<div style="margin-bottom: 10%;"></div>

Say that we conducted this study by polling an independent and representative sample of GMU students about how many colleges they applied to, and obtained a sample mean of 9.7.

The national average is 8.

.qa.center[
Is this result statistically significant?

In order to evaluate if the observed sample mean is unusual for the hypothesized sampling distribution, we do the following:

* Choose a value for the significance level *⍺* (a common choice is 5%)

* Determine the percentile rank of the observed sample mean relative to the null distribution

---

# p-values

<div style="margin-bottom: 20%;"></div>

* We then use the percentile to calculate the **p-value**, the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as our current data set, if the null hypothesis were true.

* If the p-value is **lower** than the significance level *⍺*, we say that it would be very unlikely to observe the data if the null hypothesis were true, and hence **reject _H<sub>0</sub>_**.

* If the p-value is **higher** than *⍺*, we say that it is likely to observe the data even if the null hypothesis were true, and hence **do not reject _H<sub>0</sub>_**.

  pull(p_value)
college_apps_p_value_percentage <- round(
  x = college_apps_p_value_raw * 100,
  digits = 2
)
```

<div style="margin-bottom: 7%;"></div>

* p-value = `r college_apps_p_value_raw`

* If the true average of the number of colleges GMU students applied to is 8, there is a `r college_apps_p_value_percentage`% chance of observing a random sample of 206 GMU students who on average apply to 9.7 or more schools.

* This is a pretty low probability for us to think that a sample mean of 9.7 or more schools is likely to happen simply by chance.

* Since p-value is **low** (lower than 5%) we **reject _H<sub>0</sub>_**.

* The data provide convincing evidence that GMU students apply to more than 8 schools on average.

* The difference between the null value of 8 schools and observed sample mean of 9.7 schools is **not due to chance** or sampling variability.

# Distributed version control

Git is a *distributed* version control system.

Every programmer working on the project has a copy of the entire repository for the project.

But if one programmer adds new commits, how do they share them with other programmers?

---

# Remotes

Git allows you to name a web server that also has a copy of the respository. Every developer then communicates with the server:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/git-scm-book-centralized_workflow.png")
```

* Your version of the repository is called the *local* version.

* The server's version of the repository is called the *remote* version. Every remote has a name; by convention the remote is usually called `origin`.

* We **push** our changes from the local repository to the remote.

* We **pull** to get other people's changes from the remote into our local repository.

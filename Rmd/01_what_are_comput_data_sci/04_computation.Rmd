# Big data looms

.valign-slide.quote-container[
> Big data [refers to] data sets that are so big and complex that traditional data-processing application software [is] inadequate to deal with them. Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, [and] information privacy [...] There are a number of concepts associated with big data: originally there were 3 concepts volume, variety, velocity. Other concepts later attributed with big data are veracity (i.e., how much noise is in the data) and value.

<h1 style="margin-bottom:10%">Why are new skills and training needed?</h1>

--

* The average scientific researcher devotes as much as 30% of their time developing and 40% of their time using scientific software (Hannay et. al., in SECSE Conference (2009), pp. 1-8), yet many undergraduate natural science programs do not integrate computational skills into the curriculum

--

* A lack of computational skills increases the risk of computational errors, which hurt reproducibility and can even invalidate a study's conclusions (Merali, Nature 467, 775 (2010))

--

* Automated workflows with error-checking are very important when working with large datasets

--

* Researchers in the computational and data sciences often need to communicate results to non-experts, which requires effective visualizations and developing the ability to write and present a clear and compelling story

---

<h1 style="margin-bottom:15%">Why are new skills and training needed?</h1>

* Data cleaning is a prerequisite to analyzing data in most contexts and disciplines

--

* Many computational tasks map onto workflows where you apply a series of data transformations in a certain order

--

* Data science methods applied to other fields: medicine, the humanities, political science, law, and the list goes on

---

<h1 style="margin-bottom:25%">Focus of this course</h1>

* The computational and data sciences are **very** broad

--

* Focus is on the tools, methods, and practices within *data science* category

--

  * If you also want to be introduced to the *computational science* side of things, consider taking CDS 130!

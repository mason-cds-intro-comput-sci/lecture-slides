# What is science?

Science is a way of looking at the world.

The scientific method:

* Review evidence
* Hypothesis
* Test hypothesis with experiment
* Validate or revise hypothesis

---

# What is computational science?

Computational science vs. computer science

```{r venn-diagram-comp-sci, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/venn_diagram_computational_science.svg")
```

Computational science is also known as scientific computing.

# What is data science?

```{r venn-diagram-data-sci, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/venn_diagram_data_science.svg")
```

---

# .font80[What are the computational and data sciences?]

The use of computers and data to explore problems and test hypotheses within the sciences.

```{r cs-ds-flow, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}

# Why should you care about this course?

--

The average scientific researcher spends:

* 30% of their time developing scientific software
* 40% of their time using scientific software 

...yet many undergraduate natural science programs do not integrate computational skills into the curriculum.

# Example data distribution

<div style="margin-bottom: 7%"></div>

The following distribution comes from data posted by the US Census Bureau:

```{r mean-travel-time-freq-hist-labeled, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6}
county %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = mean_work_travel)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "turquoise2", color = "turquoise4") +
  labs(
    title = "Average work travel times across 3143 US counties, 2006-2010",
    x = "Average work travel time (min)", y = "count")
```

# Download and load the dataset

<div style="margin-bottom: 20%"></div>

You can follow along by downloading and loading the dataset by placing the following *setup* code block at the top of a R Markdown file.

<pre><code>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
# Load datasets
county <- read_rds(url("http://data.cds101.com/county_complete.rds"))
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

# Useful statistical functions

<div style="margin-bottom: 8%"></div>

The following R functions will be useful for computing basic statistical measures of any numerical data column (variable)

* .mono[mean()]: Computes the average

* .mono[median()]: Computes the median

* .mono[min()]: Finds the minimum value

* .mono[max()]: Finds the maximum value

* .mono[sd()]: Computes the standard deviation

* .mono[IQR()]: Computes the interquartile range

* .mono[percent_rank()]: Computes percentiles

---

# Using the statistical functions

<div style="margin-bottom: 7%"></div>

Every function except .mono[percent_rank()] will always return a single quantity

The .mono[summarize()] function is appropriate here:

.code80[
```r
county %>%
  summarize(
    mean = mean(mean_work_travel),
    median = median(mean_work_travel),
    min = min(mean_work_travel),
    max = max(mean_work_travel),
    sd = sd(mean_work_travel),
    iqr = IQR(mean_work_travel)
  )
```
]

<div style="margin-bottom: 3%"></div>

```{r county-summary-stats, echo = FALSE}
county %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(mean_work_travel), median = median(mean_work_travel),
            min = min(mean_work_travel), max = max(mean_work_travel),
            sd = sd(mean_work_travel), iqr = IQR(mean_work_travel)) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

---

# Using the statistical functions

.mono[percent_rank()] operates on the full column of values, so it needs to be paired with .mono[mutate()]

Once we have the percentiles, we can find the cutoff value for each percentile

.code70[
```r
county %>%
  mutate(
    percentile = percent_rank(mean_work_travel),
    quartile = case_when(                      # case_when() similar to if_else()
      percentile < 0.25 ~ "Q1",                # label between 0 and 0.25 as Q1,
      between(percentile, 0.25, 0.50) ~ "Q2",  # between 0.25 and 0.50 as Q2,
      between(percentile, 0.50, 0.75) ~ "Q3",  # between 0.50 and 0.75 as Q3,
      percentile >= 0.75 ~ "Q4"                # and 0.75 to 1.00 as Q4
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(quartile) %>%
  summarize(cutoff = max(mean_work_travel))    # cutoff is maximum in quartile
```
]

<div style="margin-bottom: 3%"></div>

```{r county-quantiles, echo = FALSE}
county %>%
  mutate(
    percentile = percent_rank(mean_work_travel),
    quartile = case_when(
      percentile < 0.25 ~ "Q1",
      between(percentile, 0.25, 0.50) ~ "Q2",
      between(percentile, 0.50, 0.75) ~ "Q3",
      percentile >= 0.75 ~ "Q4"
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(quartile) %>%
  summarize(cutoff = max(mean_work_travel)) %>%
  spread(key = quartile, value = cutoff) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

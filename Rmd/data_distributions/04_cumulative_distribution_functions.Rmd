## Cumulative distribution functions

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# DO NOT ALTER THIS CHUNK
source("../../R/xaringan_setup.R")
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Download and load the dataset

<div style="margin-bottom: 20%"></div>

You can follow along by downloading and loading the dataset by placing the following *setup* code block at the top of a R Markdown file.

<pre><code>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
# Load datasets
county <- read_rds(url("http://data.cds101.com/county_complete.rds"))
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

# Data by percentile rank

* Probability mass functions (PMFs) are handy exploratory tools, but as with histograms, the bin width can strongly influence what your plot looks like

* The density plots offer a reasonable alternative to the PMFs, however, comparing distributions with different widths, multiple outliers, or very skewed data can still be challenging.

* A convenient way to overcome this problem if we convert the data into a sorted list of percentile ranks

* **Advantages**

  * Don't need to select a bin width
  
  * Easier to compare similarities and differences of different data distributions
  
  * Different classes of data distributions have distinct shapes

* The **cumulative distribution function** (CDF) lets us map between percentile rank and each value in a data column

# Creating CDFs in R 

.mono[ggplot2] comes with a handy convenience function .mono[stat_ecdf()], which lets you create and visualize CDFs

```{r county-commute-cdf-all}
ggplot(county) +
  stat_ecdf(mapping = aes(x = mean_work_travel)) +
  labs(y = "CDF")
```

count: false

  geom_vline(
    xintercept = median(pull(county, mean_work_travel)),

# Creating CDFs in R

We can do all the usual operations, such as grouping by state

```r
county %>%
  filter(state == "Virginia" | state == "Maryland") %>%
  ggplot() +
  stat_ecdf(mapping = aes(x = mean_work_travel, color = state)) +
  labs(y = "CDF")
```

```{r county-commute-cdf-va-md, echo = FALSE}
county %>%
  filter(state == "Virginia" | state == "Maryland") %>%
  ggplot() +
  stat_ecdf(mapping = aes(x = mean_work_travel, color = state)) +
  labs(y = "CDF")
```

# Computing the CDF

<div style="margin-bottom: 18%"></div>

To compute the CDF, we use the .mono[cume_dist()] function along with .mono[filter()], .mono[group_by()], and .mono[mutate()]:

```{r county-extract-cdf-2}
va_md_cdf_df <- county %>%
  filter(state == "Virginia" | state == "Maryland") %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(cdf = cume_dist(mean_work_travel)) %>%
  select(state, mean_work_travel, cdf)
```

---

count: false

# Get CDF data out of plot

<div style="margin-bottom: 8%"></div>

```{r country-extract-cdf-table, echo = FALSE}
va_md_cdf_df %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(state), cdf, mean_work_travel) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

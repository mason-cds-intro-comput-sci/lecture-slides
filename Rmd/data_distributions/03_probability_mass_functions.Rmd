# Data distributions

<div style="margin-bottom: 5%"></div>

We've already learned that histograms (.mono[geom_histogram()]) are a convenient way to represent numerical data in a single column (variable)

<div style="margin-bottom: 5%"></div>

```{r county-mean-driving-table-head, echo = FALSE}
county %>%
  select(mean_work_travel) %>%

A histogram represents the **frequency** that values show up for a given variable

.mono[binwidth] changes the "buckets" for the data, impacting the frequency heights.

# .font70[Comparing distributions with unequal observations]

So far, we've largely skipped over the question of how to compare distributions with varying numbers of observations.

In our current example of average times to travel to work, we can group the data by state and compare Virginia to Maryland.

```{r county-va-md-mean-driving-histogram, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%", fig.width = 4}
county %>%
  filter(state == "Virginia" | state == "Maryland") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = mean_work_travel, fill = state, color = state),
    binwidth = 2, center = 0, position = "identity", alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(y = "frequency") +
  coord_fixed() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = combine(2.5, 47.5))

# .font70[Comparing distributions with unequal observations]

So far, we've largely skipped over the question of how to compare distributions with varying numbers of observations.

In our current example of average times to travel to work, we can group the data by state and compare Virginia to Maryland.

```{r county-va-md-mean-driving-histogram, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%", fig.width = 4}
```

In the dataset, Virginia has `r nrow(filter(county, state == "Virginia"))` counties compared to Maryland's `r nrow(filter(county, state == "Maryland"))` counties.

We need to **normalize** the frequency counts.

---

# From frequency to probability

Normalization is straightforward, just divide the frequency count in each "bucket" by the total number of observations in the histogram.

If you group by categories, that you should divide by the number of observations in each group.

To normalize the histograms from the prior example, we need to divide the Virginia frequencies by `r nrow(filter(county, state == "Virginia"))` and the Maryland frequencies by `r nrow(filter(county, state == "Maryland"))`.

```{r county-va-md-mean-driving-histogram, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%", fig.width = 4}

# Probability mass function (PMF)

```{r county-va-md-mean-driving-pmf, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%", fig.width = 4}
```

Just like a histogram, except that the bar heights reflect **probabilities** instead of **frequency counts**.

Allows for a meaningful comparison of distributions with different numbers of observations.

# Creating PMFs in R

Assign the figure to a variable

```{r county-extract-pmf-1}
va_md_pmf_figure <- county %>%
  filter(state == "Virginia" | state == "Maryland") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = mean_work_travel, y = ..density.., fill = state),
    binwidth = 2,
    center = 0
  )
```
]

Use .mono[ggplot_build()] with .mono[purrr::pluck()] and .mono[as_data_frame()] as follows:

.code80[
```{r county-extract-pmf-2}
va_md_pmf_data <- va_md_pmf_figure %>%
  ggplot_build() %>%
  purrr::pluck("data", 1) %>%

# Density plots as an alternative

As an alternative to the probability mass function, we can also use the density plots provided in ggplot2. Unlike the histograms, they are automatically normalized.

.code80[
```r
county %>%
  filter(state == "Virginia" | state == "Maryland") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(
    mapping = aes(x = mean_work_travel, fill = state),
    alpha = 0.5
  )
```
]

.pull-left[
```{r county-freq-to-pmf-2, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.width = 4}
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r county-density-plot, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.width = 4}
county %>%
  filter(state == "Virginia" | state == "Maryland") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(
    mapping = aes(
      x = mean_work_travel,
      fill = state
    ),
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  labs(y = "density") +
  coord_cartesian(
    xlim = combine(2.5, 47.5)
  )
```

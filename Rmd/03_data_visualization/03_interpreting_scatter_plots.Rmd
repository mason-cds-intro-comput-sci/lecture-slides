# The purpose of a scatter plot

A scatter plot tells us about the relationship between two variables (i.e. how they co-vary).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
starwars %>%
  # filter(name != "Jabba Desilijic Tiure") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  labs(title = "Mass and height of Star Wars characters")
```

How can we describe this relationship?

# Linearity

A scatter plot can tell us whether two variables have a linear (i.e. straight) relationship or a non-linear relationship (i.e. curved)

.pull-left[

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, out.width="100%"}
set.seed(42)
x <- runif(100)*20
y <- x + rnorm(100)
ggplot(tibble(x,y), aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(size=0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Linear")
```

If you can draw a straight line (i.e. a line with a constant slope) through the data, then it has a linear relationship.
]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, out.width="100%"}
set.seed(42)
x <- runif(100)*10
y <- x^2/5 + rnorm(100)
ggplot(tibble(x,y), aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) + geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Non-linear")
```

If a line drawn through the data is curved (variable slope), then the relationship is non-linear.

# Describing linear relationships

Positive, negative, no-relationship

# Degree of correlation

Two variables can be linearly related, even if they are poorly correlated.

Both of these graphs show a linear relationship:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.width=4}
set.seed(42)
x <- runif(100)*20
y1 <- x + rnorm(100,0,3)
y2 <- x + rnorm(100,0,20)
tibble(x,"Highly correlated" = y1, "Poorly correlated" = y2) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Highly correlated", "Poorly correlated")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x,value)) +
    geom_point(size=0.3) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 2)
```

# Don't be fooled

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, out.width="100%", fig.asp=1}
set.seed(42)
x <- runif(100)*20
y <- x + x*rnorm(100)
ggplot(tibble(x,y), aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(size=0.5) #+ geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE)
```

This data might not look linearly related...

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, out.width="100%", fig.asp=1}
set.seed(42)
x <- runif(100)*20
y <- x + x*rnorm(100)
ggplot(tibble(x,y), aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(size=0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE)
```

...but although the amount of correlation varies, the relationship is still best described with a straight line.

# Return of the ~~Jedi~~ Mass vs. height

.qa[
How would you describe this relationship? What other variables would help us understand data points that don't follow the overall trend?
]

```{r starwars-height-mass-2, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height in Star Wars characters")
```

# Spotting outliers

.qa[
Who is the not so tall but really massive character?
]

```r
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass))
```

.pull-left[
```{r starwars-height-mass-3, fig.width=4, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height in Star Wars characters")
```

.pull-right[
```{r jabba-the-hut, out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/jabba.png")

# A refresher on functions

A function is a piece of code that we can reuse. A function takes inputs and returns an output.

We can **call** an existing function within our code.

```r
some_function(parameter_1 = argument_1, parameter 2 = argument_2)
```

What might a function for creating graphs look like?

# The `qplot()` function

We can use the `qplot()` function to create a graph.

```r
qplot(x = height, y = mass, data = starwars)
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
qplot(x = height, y = mass, data = starwars)
```

Packages in R are like expansions in video games. They are extensions of the basic system that allow you to do new things. There are a huge number of R packages.

# How does this work?

```r
qplot(x = height, y = mass, data = starwars)
```

`starwars` is a dataset about characters in the Star Wars universe. 

`height` and `mass` are 2 of the columns in this dataset:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
starwars %>%
  select(name, height, mass) %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```


???

It's worth taking a look at the dataset and making sure that you know what each row and column represents.

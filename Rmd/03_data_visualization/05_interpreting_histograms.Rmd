# Histograms

* Histograms provide a view of the **data density**.
  Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common.

* Histograms are especially convenient for describing the **shape** of the data distribution.

* The chosen **bin width** can alter the story the histogram is telling.

```{r extracurr-hrs-hist, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/extracurr_hrs_hist.svg")

Modality

```{r modality-drawings, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/modality_drawings.png")
```

Skewness

```{r skewness-drawings, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/skewness_drawings.png")
```

# Shape of a distribution: modality

.qa[
Does the histogram have a single prominent peak (unimodal), several prominent peaks (bimodal/multimodal), or no apparent peaks (uniform)?
]

<div style="margin-bottom: 10%;"></div>

```{r single-bi-multi-modal-unif-plots, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/singleBiMultiModalUnifPlots.svg")
```

.footnote[
In order to determine modality, step back and imagine a smooth curve over the histogram â€“ imagine that the bars are wooden blocks and you drop a spaghetti over them, the shape the spaghetti would take could be viewed as a smooth curve.
]

# Shape of a distribution: skewness

.qa[
Is the histogram right skewed, left skewed, or symmetric?
]

<div style="margin-bottom: 10%;"></div>

```{r skewed-sym-plots, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/skewedSymPlots.svg")
```

.footnote[
Histograms are said to be skewed to the side of the long tail.
]

# .font80[Shape of a distribution: unusual observations]

.qa[
Are there any unusual observations or potential outliers?
]

<div style="margin-bottom: 10%;"></div>

```{r outlier-plots, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/outlierPlots.svg")
```

# .font80[Describing shapes of numerical distributions]

When interpreting a histogram, you should note:

.valign-slide[
* shape:

  * skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)

  * modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform

* center: mean, median, mode (not always useful)

<!-- * spead: range, standard deviation, inter-quartile range -->

* unusual observations (e.g. outliers)

# A taxonomy for data graphics

.valign-slide[
* We can break visualizations down into four basic elements:

  * Visual cues
  
  * Coordinate system
  
  * Scale
  
  * Context
]

---

# Visual cues

.valign-slide[
*   These are the building blocks of any given visualization.

*   Identify 9 separate visual cues.
]

---

# Cues 1&ndash;9

.valign-slide[
1. **Position** (numerical) where in relation to other things?

2. **Length** (numerical) how big (in one dimension)?

3. **Angle** (numerical) how wide? parallel to something else?

4. **Direction** (numerical) at what slope? In a time series, going up or down?

5. **Shape** (categorical) belonging to which group?

6. **Area** (numerical) how big (in two dimensions)?

7. **Volume** (numerical) how big (in three dimensions)?

8. **Shade** (either) to what extent? how severly?

9. **Color** (either) to what extent? how severly? Beware of red/green color blindness.

# Coordinate systems

.valign-slide[
1. **Cartesian** This is the familiar (*x*, *y*)-rectangular coordinate system with two perpendicular axes

2. **Polar**: The radial analog of the Cartesian system with points identified by their radius *ρ* and angle *θ*

3. **Geographic**: Locations on the curved surface of the Earth, but represented in a flat two-dimensional plane
]

---

# Scale

.valign-slide[
1. **Numeric**: A numeric quantity is most commonly set on a *linear*, *logarithmic*, or *percentage* scale.

2. **Categorical**: A categorical variable may have no ordering or it may be *ordinal* (position in a series).

3. **Time**: A numeric quantity with special properties.
    Because of the calendar, it can be specified using a series of units (year, month, day).
    It can also be considered cyclically (years reset back to January, a spring oscillating around a central position).

# Context

.valign-slide[
* Annotations and labels that draw attention to specific parts of a visualization.

  * Titles, subtitles
  
  * Axes labels that depict scale (tick mark labels) and indiciate the variable
  
  * Reference points or lines
  
  * Other markups such as arrows, textboxes, and so on (it's possible to overdo these)
]

# Example plot

.center[How many of the previous elements can you identify in this plot?]

```{r mpg-example-identify, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  labs(title = "Engine size and gas mileage on the highway",
       x = "Engine size",
       y = "Mileage on highway") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5)),
        axis.title = element_text(size = rel(1.1)),
        axis.text = element_text(size = rel(0.9)),
        strip.text = element_text(size = rel(0.9)))
```

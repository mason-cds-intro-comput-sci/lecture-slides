<h1 style="margin-bottom: 15%;">Poor visualizations may lead to tragedy</h1>

*   The *Challenger* disaster, January 28th, 1986

--

*   The Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into flight, all seven crew members died

--

*   The rubber O-rings, which held the rockets together, had failed due to the low temperatures (below 30°F)

--

*   Engineers at Morton Thiokol, who supplied solid rocket motors to NASA, warned about this on January 27th, 1986 in a conference call

--

*   NASA and the managers at Morton Thiokol overruled their concerns, unpersuaded by the engineers

Mathematician Edward Tufte issued a critique and argued that the data should have been presented this way:

# *How to Lie with Statistics*

<div style="margin-bottom: 15%;"></div>

Book by Darrell Huff, published in 1954

<div style="margin-bottom: 6%;"></div>

--

* The title is tongue-in-cheek and is usually misunderstood. The book is not a guide for or about "fudging the numbers" with statistics.

--

* Illustrates ways that visualizations can be manipulated such that they are misleading, but technically show accurate information

# .font60[Side note: How do we have a record going back to the 1880s?]

.valign-slide[
Temperatures from the 1800s and onward were recorded using thermometers at various locations around the globe, and by the 1880s thermometers had become precise.
Systematic measurements began around the mid-1800s at various army posts, and in 1891 the National Weather Service was formed to continue the effort.

# .font80[Principles and ethics for scientific visualizations]

<div style="margin-bottom:10%;"></div>

1.  Present your results transparently and honestly

--

2.  Show all data, including outliers, that are valid measurements

--

3.  Use graph layouts that show trends and lets readers easily read quantitative values

--

4.  Do not break conventions regarding scaling, axis orientation, the type of plot to use, etc.

--

5.  If you leave something out of a visualization, say so and justify it

--

6.  Strongly consider including your datasets and any scripts used to create figures with your reports or journal articles

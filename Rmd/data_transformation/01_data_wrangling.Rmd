# The word "wrangle"

* So, by analogy, "wrangling data" means to collect, clean, and organize digital information (tend and round up)

--

* Informal word, but data scientists will understand what you mean if you use it

--

* In practice, data wrangling requires the use of data transformations to accomplish tasks related to processing, structuring, and analysis.

# `ggplot2` needs clean/tidy datasets

* Datasets such as the `mpg` dataset are small and nicely organized

--

* It would be nice if all datasets were like this! ...but they're the exceptions to the rule

--

* Most raw datasets need cleaning, and this is where data scientists will spend **most** of their time

* **import** → obtain data and get it into R

--

* **tidy** → reshape rows and columns to follow the [Tidy data rules](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)

--

* **transform** → cleaning the dataset (not the same as tidying) as well as "slicing and dicing" the dataset for exploration and analysis.

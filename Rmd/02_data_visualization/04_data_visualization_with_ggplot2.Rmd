# Star Wars data

Loading `tidyverse` also loads a dataset called `starwars` into your RStudio environment:

.code70[
```r
library(tidyverse)
starwars
```
]

.code70[
```{r star-wars-table, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
starwars
```
]

---

# Dataset terminology

.qa[
What does each row represent? What does each column represent?
]

.code70[
```{r star-wars-table, message = FALSE}
```
]

---

# Luke Skywalker

.valign-slide[
```{r luke-skywalker-data, height = "100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/luke-skywalker.png")
```
]

# What's in the Star Wars data?

Take a `glimpse` at the data:

```{r glimpse-star-wars}
glimpse(starwars)
```

---

# What's in the Star Wars data?

.pull-left[
Run the following **in the Console** to view the help

```r
?starwars
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r starwars-helpdata, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/starwars-help.png")
```
]

--

.qa[
How many rows and columns does this dataset have? 

What does each row represent? What does each column represent?
]

--

.qa[
Make a prediction: What relationship do you expect to see between height and mass?
]

---

# Mass vs. height (`geom_point()`)

Not all characters have height and mass information (hence 28 of them not plotted)

```{r starwars-height-mass-1}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass))
```

---

# Mass vs. height

.qa[
How would you describe this relationship? What other variables would help us understand data points that don't follow the overall trend?
]

```{r starwars-height-mass-2, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x = height, y = mass))
```

---

# Mass vs. height

.qa[
Who is the not so tall but really massive character?
]

```r
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass))
```

.pull-left[
```{r starwars-height-mass-3, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r jabba-the-hut, out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/jabba.png")
```
]

---

# Additional variables

.valign-slide[
Can display additional variables with

*   aesthetics (like shape, colour, size), or

*   faceting (small multiples displaying different subsets)
]

---

# Aesthetics

.valign-slide[
Visual characteristics of plotting characters that can be **mapped to data** are

* `color`

* `size`

* `shape`

* `alpha` (transparency)
]

---

# Mass vs. height + gender

```{r starwars-mass-height-gender, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender))
```

---

# Aesthetics summary

* Continuous variable are measured on a continuous scale

* Discrete variables are measured (or often counted) on a discrete scale

| aesthetics    | discrete                 | continuous                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| color         | rainbow of colors        | gradient                                |
| size          | discrete steps           | linear mapping between radius and value |
| shape         | different shape for each | shouldn't (and doesn't) work            |

---

# Faceting

.valign-slide[
* Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data

* Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data
]

---

# Mass vs. height by gender

```{r starwars-mass-height-gender-facet-1, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender)
```

---

# Many ways to facet

.valign-slide[
In the next few examples, think about what each plot displays.
Think about how the code relates to the output.
]

---

# Many ways to facet

```{r starwars-mass-height-gender-facet-2, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(gender ~ .)
```

---

# Many ways to facet

```{r starwars-mass-height-gender-facet-3, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender)
```

---

# Many ways to facet

```{r starwars-mass-height-gender-facet-4, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_wrap(~ eye_color)
```

---

# Facet summary

.valign-slide[
*   `facet_grid()`: 2d grid, rows ~ cols, . for no split

*   `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped into 2d
]

---

# Other geoms

.qa[
How are these plots similar? How are they different?
]

--

```{r starwars-point-vs-smooth, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
p1 <- ggplot(starwars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = height, y = mass))

p2 <- ggplot(starwars) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = height, y = mass))

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

---

# `geom_smooth`

To plot a smooth curve, use `geom_smooth()`

```{r starwars-height-mass-smooth, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass))
```

---

# Histograms

For numerical variables

```{r starwars-histogram, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(starwars) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = height), binwidth = 10)
```

---

# Bar plots

For categorical variables

```{r starwars-bar-plot, out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(starwars) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = gender))
```

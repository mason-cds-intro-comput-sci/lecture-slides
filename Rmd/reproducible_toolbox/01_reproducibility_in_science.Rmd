* Empirical observations constitute evidence.

* A hypothesis is compared with the outcomes of the natural world ("Nature"), not voted on by an individual or a committee

* A hypothesis should be testable by anyone, regardless of time, place, culture, etc. Anyone can double check an experiment!

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 12%">Reproducibility in practice</h1>

The scientific ideal of reproducibility is sometimes easier said than done, and there many reasons why this is the case:

--

* Lack of funding sources

--

* Lack of data sharing

--

* Lack of interest

--

* "Top-tier" journals won't publish

--

* Vague methods

--

* And more...

> Brian Nosek of University of Virginia and colleagues sought out to replicate 100 different studies that all were published in 2008. The project pulled these studies from three different [psychology] journals... to see if they could get the same results as the initial findings. [...] Only 36.1% of the studies [were] replicated.

A graduate student at U. Mass. Amherst, T. Herndon, tried to replicate the study's results using publicly available country spreadsheet data...
--
 and could not.

--

In 2013, T. Herndon wrote to Reinhart and Rogoff asking for their dataset, and they obliged.

--

After receiving the data and analysis, T. Herndon, working with Profs. M. Ash and R. Pollin, published a critique based on the following:

--

1. The selective exclusion of available data and data gaps

--

2. A spreadsheet coding error

--

3. Unconventional weighting of summary statistics

# The war over supercooled water

Two different chemists ran simulations to see what happens when water is supercooled to around $\text{-40 }^{\circ}\text{C}$, where it will spontaneously freeze even if it is free of impurities.

.pull-right.font80[
<div style="margin-top: 8%"></div>

One of them found that water morphed back and forth between a water-like form and an ice-like form. The other chemist, who was very famous in this field, only found the water-like form. But, based on the details of their simulations, they should have gotten the same result.

> Over the next seven years, the perplexing discrepancy would ignite a bitter conflict, with junior scientists caught in the crossfire. At stake were not only the reputations of the two groups but also a peculiar theory that sought to explain some of water’s deepest and most enduring mysteries. Earlier this year, the dispute was finally settled. And as it turns out, the entire ordeal was the result of botched code.

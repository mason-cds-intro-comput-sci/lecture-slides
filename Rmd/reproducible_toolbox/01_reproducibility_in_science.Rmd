* Empirical observations constitute evidence.

* A hypothesis is compared with the outcomes of the natural world ("Nature"), not voted on by an individual or a committee

* A hypothesis should be testable by anyone, regardless of time, place, culture, etc. Anyone can double check an experiment!

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 12%">Reproducibility in practice</h1>

The scientific ideal of reproducibility is sometimes easier said than done, and there many reasons why this is the case:

--

* Lack of funding sources

--

* Lack of data sharing

--

* Lack of interest

--

* "Top-tier" journals won't publish

--

* Vague methods

--

* And more...

> Brian Nosek of University of Virginia and colleagues sought out to replicate 100 different studies that all were published in 2008. The project pulled these studies from three different [psychology] journals... to see if they could get the same results as the initial findings. [...] Only 36.1% of the studies [were] replicated.

A graduate student at U. Mass. Amherst, T. Herndon, tried to replicate the study's results using publicly available country spreadsheet data...

 and could not.

--

In 2013, T. Herndon wrote to Reinhart and Rogoff asking for their dataset, and they obliged.

--

After receiving the data and analysis, T. Herndon, working with Profs. M. Ash and R. Pollin, published a critique based on the following:

--

1. The selective exclusion of available data and data gaps

--

2. A spreadsheet coding error

--

3. Unconventional weighting of summary statistics

# The war over supercooled water

Two different chemists ran simulations to see what happens when water is supercooled to around $\text{-40 }^{\circ}\text{C}$, where it will spontaneously freeze even if it is free of impurities.

.pull-right.font80[
<div style="margin-top: 8%"></div>

One of them found that water morphed back and forth between a water-like form and an ice-like form. The other chemist, who was very famous in this field, only found the water-like form. But, based on the details of their simulations, they should have gotten the same result.

> Over the next seven years, the perplexing discrepancy would ignite a bitter conflict, with junior scientists caught in the crossfire. At stake were not only the reputations of the two groups but also a peculiar theory that sought to explain some of waterâ€™s deepest and most enduring mysteries. Earlier this year, the dispute was finally settled. And as it turns out, the entire ordeal was the result of botched code.

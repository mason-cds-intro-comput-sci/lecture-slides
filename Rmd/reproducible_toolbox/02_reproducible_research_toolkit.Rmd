.qa[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

Near-term goals:

* Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?

* Does the code actually do what you think it does?

* In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? (e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

Long-term goals:

* Can the code be used for other data?

* Can you extend the code to do other things?

# Some R history

.valign-slide[
* The first stable version of R, v1.0.0, was released on February 29, 2000.

* R itself is an implementation of the [S programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language), which was designed at Bell Laboratories in the mid-1970s.

* *Base R* was built for statisticians and for doing data analysis, but not necessarily for modern Data Science

* It's age and legacy brings along old implementations of data structures and abbreviated function (commands) names

# Modernizing R with `tidyverse`

.valign-slide[
Over the last 3 years, chief scientist at RStudio, Hadley Wickham, has brought R into the modern era with the `tidyverse`.

.quote-container[
> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.
> All packages share an underlying philosophy and common APIs.
.cite[[Front page of the Tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/)]
]

In practice, this meant reducing everything to a small, core set of commands that all behave in a similar way.

<h1 style="margin-bottom: 9%;">R essentials</h1>

A short list (for now):

--

* Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

  ```r
  do_this(to_this)
  do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
  ```

--

* Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

  ```r
  install.packages("package_name")
  library(package_name)
  ```

--

* Packages bring in additional functions for us to use!

# R Markdown

```{r hello-r-markdown, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/hello-r-markdown.png")
```

.font80[
* Fully reproducible reports – each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning

* Simple markdown syntax for text

* Code goes in chunks, defined by three back-ticks, narrative goes outside of chunks
]

count: false

# R Markdown

```{r hello-r-markdown, echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
```

<div style="margin-top: 5%"></div>

# How will we use R Markdown?

.vhalign-slide[
* You will submit all your homework assignments and the final group project as an R Markdown document

* You will be shown examples in the form of "real-time" demos inside an R Markdown document. While watching, you should create your own document and follow along!

* For assignments, you'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with

# Tidy gradebook dataset exercise

.vhalign-slide[
Download the GitHub Classroom repo and complete the following exercises:

1. Make the dataset tidy using either .mono[gather] or .mono[spread]. The tidy gradebook should have one observation per row, which gives all the grades a student has received for the different assignments in the semester.

2. Use the tidy gradebook and create a histogram that answers the question, "What was the grade distribution for the Midterm Exam?"

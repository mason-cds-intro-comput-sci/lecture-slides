# How to answer your question

* Data visualization

* Summary statistics

* Modeling or/and(!) hypothesis test

---

# Data visualization

* Explore the variation in your data
  * Scatter plots
  * PDFs (histogram/density plot) and CDFs (eCDF)

* See how the variables are affected by other variables
  * Facet over other variables
  
* Look for problems in your data
  * How is it distributed? Normally or otherwise?
  * Are there outliers? (Try using boxplots)

Don't forget to describe:

1. Why you are creating each plot.
2. What your visualizations show.

# Summary statistics

    reduced_dataset %>%
      group_by(any_groups_you_are_investigating) %>%
      summarize(
         mean = mean(column_of_interest),
         median = ...,
         ...,
         standard_deviation = ...,
         ...
      )

Consider each column as a whole, as well as looking at the effect of any groups.

# Models and inference

If your question is in the form:

.qa[is there a relationship between *continuous_response_variable_1* and *continuous_explanatory_variable_2* (and *continuous_explanatory_variable_3*, etc.)?]
  
then you should create a model (Module 8).

If your question is in the form:

.qa[is there a significant difference in *variable_1* between two categories of *categorical_variable_2*?]

then you should use a hypothesis test (Module 7).

(For a hypothesis test, we compare the difference in mean if *variable_1* is continuous, or the difference in proportions if *variable_1* is categorical).
